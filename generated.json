    "description": "HAT-P-7b is a Gas Giant 1000 light years away from us. It was discovered in 2008 with the transit method and orbits its star HAT-P-7 in 2.2 days. This gas giant has almost twice Jupiter’s mass and 1.5 times Jupiter’s radius. HAT-P-7b has an atmosphere with strong winds moving across the planet. The clouds in this atmosphere will likely contain corundum, which is the building block of rubies and sapphires. "

    "name": "Kepler-70b",
    "description": "Kepler-70b is a terrestrial planet 4015 lightyears away. It was discovered in 2008 by orbital brightness modulation. Its size used to be the same as Jupiter until it got devoured by its star. Most planets don’t survive this trip but Kepler-70b survived and is now 0.76 times earth's radius. It is still very close to its dead star which implies a very small orbital period of 0.2 days. The surface temperature of 6800 ℃ makes it one of the hottest exoplanets out there."

    "name": "TrEs-2b",
    "description": "TrES-2b is a gas giant 702 light years away. It was discovered in 2006 with the transit method and has a small orbital period of 2.5 days. This planet is one of the most evil-looking planets and is also called the planet of eternal night. This planet is less reflective than coal and you would only see darkness inside its atmosphere. From outside, the planet has a reddish glow caused by the burning atmosphere. "

    "name": "Kepler-7b",
    "description": "Kepler-7b is a gas giant 3009 light years away from us. It was discovered in 2006 with the transit method and has a small orbital period of 4.9 days. This planet is 60 percent larger than Jupiter but only has 40 percent of its mass, which makes it as dense as Styrofoam. It is tidally locked to its star which means that one side gets roasted and the other side is freezing cold. But weather patterns revealed that clouds conduct heat from one side to the other."

    "name": "Kepler-16b",
    "description": "Kepler-16b is a gas giant 245 light years away from us. It was discovered in 2011 with the transit method and has a more earth-like orbital period of 229 days. This is the first discovered planet that is in a so-called “circumbinary” orbit. This means that it circles two different stars. Like the planet Tatooine in Star-Wars, this planet also has two sunsets if someone was able to stand on the surface."

    "name": "Trappist-1e",
    "description": "Trappist-1e is a terrestrial planet 41 light years away from us. It was discovered in 2017 with the transit method and has an orbital period of only 6 days. This means that it is very close to its star but the star is cooler and dimmer than our sun, which means that Trappist-1e is actually in the habitable zone. It is one of the most promising habitable exoplanets out there since it has a lot of similarities with earth, like radius, mass and temperature."

    "name": "HD 189733 b",
    "description": "HD 189733 b is a gas giant 64 light years away from us. It was discovered in 2005 with the radial velocity method and has an orbital period of 2.2 days. It shares a lot of properties with Jupiter: 13% heavier and 13% bigger radius. This planet looks like a blue heaven on the outside, but its atmosphere contains clouds filled with glass and the winds storm with a speed of 2 km/s. Entering this atmosphere will instantly kill you with millions of cuts."

    "name": "J1407b",
    "description": "Not a lot of information of J1407b is available, since it has only been observed once in 2007. But we do know that it is a very special planet. Scientists predict that it has a massive orbital period. J1407b is also known as  a “Saturn on steroids”. It has more than 30 rings compared to the 7 of Saturn and they stretch 123 million kilometers in diameter. If Saturn had rings like J1407b, it would be as visibly large as three suns from our planet."

    "name": "Cancri E",
    "description": "Cancri E, also known as Janssen, is a super earth 41 light years away from us. It was discovered in 2004 with the radial velocity method and has an orbital period of 0.7 days. Its star is so close to the planet that the surface is fully molten. It was believed in 2012 that its core was mostly made up of carbon which would imply that it should contain a lot of diamonds and graphite but more recent studies showed that the carbon-to-oxygen ratio is way smaller."

    "name": "Kepler-11b",
    "description": "Kepler-11b is a terrestrial planet 2108 light years away from us. It was discovered in 2010 with the transit method and has an orbital period of 10.3 days. It is part of the Kepler-11 system with 5 other planets that are a mix of rock and gas planets. This system is one of the most unique systems we know of: it is super compact. The 5 most inner planets would fit between mercury and the sun. The other one, Kepler-11g, would orbit between mercury and venus."

    "name": "Gliese 1132b is a super earth 41 light year away from us. It was discovered in 2015 with the transit method and has an orbital period of 1.6 days. This planet was first a world with a thick hydrogen atmosphere. Due to the radiation of its young star, the atmosphere got crushed and would in normal conditions shred the surface. But this planet was able to create a second atmosphere that is slowly filling itself with the hydrogen escaping volcanos.",

    "description": "WASP-12b is a gas giant 1393 light year away from us. It was discovered in 2008 with the transit method and has an orbital period of 1.1 days. This must be the most unique planet that we know of. This planet is slowly dying since its sun is destroying its atmosphere. WASP-12b has not a normal shape. Due to the enormous tidal forces on this planet, it is stretched into the shape of an egg. It is expected that this planet will be eaten by its sun in 10 million years."

    "name": "PSO j318.5-22",
    "description": "PSO j318.5-22 is a rogue planet 12 million light years away from us. It was discovered in 2013 by direct imaging. A rogue planet is a planet that does not orbit a parent star. These planets were likely orbiting a star many years ago, but something must have happened to disturb the orbit. Many theories are shaped that could cause this but none of them have been confirmed. Most likely a massive third object swung the planet out of its orbit."

    "description": "Proxima centauri b is a super earth 4 light years away from us. It was discovered in 2016 by the radial velocity method and has an orbital period of 11.2 days. Proxima Centauri b is the closest potentially habitable exoplanet that we know of. It has approximately the same radius as earth, 27 percent more weight and it orbits in the habitable zone. This super earth is probably the first exoplanet that we can deeply investigate since it is only 4 light years away."

    "description": "Kepler-22b is a super earth 635 light years away from us. It was discovered in 2011 with the transit method and has an orbital period of 290 days. Kepler-22b is still a mystery for us on how it looks, but scientists suggest that it could be covered in a superocean.  According to computer modeling, this super earth could be perfectly habitable. It also has a slight radical tilt just like earth, which makes seasons possible."

    "description": "Kelt-9b is a gas giant 667 light years away from us. It was discovered in 2017 with the transit method and has an orbital period of 1.5 days. Kelt-9b is one of the hottest planets with its dayside temperature at 4300 ℃ which is hotter than some stars. This temperature is caused by the young A type star. Molecules will not remain intact at this temperature and can only re-form at the night side of the planet."
